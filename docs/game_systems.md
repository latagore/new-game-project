# Game Systems Overview

This document breaks down the core systems mentioned in the creative brief for Arcane Dominion.

## 1. Dual Role System

**Core Concept**: Players operate on two levels simultaneously.

### God Role
- Divine perspective and powers
- Shape reality through magic
- Long-term strategic influence
- Domain expansion

### Priest Role
- Ground-level agent in the world
- Direct interaction with settlements and factions
- Personal relationships and alliances
- Physical presence and vulnerability

**Interaction**: Actions taken as priest affect god power and vice versa. Separate reputation/relationship tracks for each role.

---

## 2. Influence & Domain System

**Purpose**: Spread the god's domain across the world through various means.

### Influence Methods
- **Village Diplomacy**: Building relationships with settlements
- **Shrine Establishment**: Creating physical anchors of divine power
- **Relic Connection**: Linking to ancient artifacts of power
- **Territory Control**: Capturing and holding strategic locations

### Influence Consequences
- Expanded areas of control
- Access to unique bonuses and resources
- Increased target visibility for enemies
- Potential for overextension

---

## 3. Settlement & Alliance System

**Purpose**: Create a network of allied villages and factions.

### Village Relationships
- **Friendship Building**: Gradual relationship development
- **Distinct Bonuses**: Each village provides unique benefits
- **Alliance Types**: 
  - Priest-aligned (personal loyalty)
  - Religion-aligned (shared faith)
  - Both or neither (complex politics)
- **Loss Impact**: Tangible mechanical loss when villages are destroyed or turn against you

### Alliance Management
- Track relationship status
- Protect allies from threats
- Balance competing interests
- Risk of betrayal or abandonment

---

## 4. Shrine & Sacred Site System

**Purpose**: Establish permanent anchors of divine power.

### Shrine Mechanics
- **Establishment**: Process of creating new shrines
- **Bonuses**: Unique benefits per shrine location
- **Vulnerability**: Shrines can be attacked and destroyed
- **Protection**: Ongoing defense requirements
- **Network Effects**: Multiple shrines may synergize

### Sacred Sites
- Leyline intersections
- Ancient relic locations
- Natural power sources
- Strategic terrain features

---

## 5. Resource Management System

**Purpose**: Balance multiple resource types for survival and growth.

### Resource Types

#### Leylines
- Natural magical conduits
- Must be captured and held
- Provide ongoing magical resources
- Vulnerable to enemy capture

#### Natural Resources
- Harvest from controlled territories
- Different regions provide different resources
- Depletion and regeneration mechanics
- Environmental consequences of exploitation

#### Focus (Tactical Resource)
- Quick regeneration
- Used for frequent, lower-power spells
- Tactical decision-making resource

#### Essence (Strategic Resource)
- Slow regeneration
- Used for devastating/high-impact spells
- Strategic planning resource
- Risk of overheat from overuse

### Resource Protection
- Defend resource-generating locations
- Crisis events that threaten supply
- Loss of resources when locations fall

---

## 6. Living World Event System

**Purpose**: Create a dynamic world that operates independently of player action.

### Autonomous Threats

#### Bandits
- Independent bandit groups
- Random attack decisions
- Target vulnerable settlements and resources
- May be created by player actions (refugees from destroyed cities)

#### Monsters
- Ancient creatures and awakened threats
- Triggered by magical disruption
- Variable alliance potential
- Must be destroyed or controlled

#### Rival Nations
- Motivated by competing gods
- Strategic targeting of player allies
- Form temporary coalitions against powerful players
- Exploit player weaknesses

### Event Triggers
- Time-based events
- Player action consequences
- Power level thresholds
- Random world chaos

---

## 7. Combat System

**Purpose**: Tactical battles that combine MOBA-style execution with strategic planning.

### Combat Style Options

#### Battle Brothers Approach
- Control 12 units (brothers/priests)
- Fight against larger enemy forces
- High-stakes survival combat
- Every unit matters

#### Total War Approach
- Idling/automated combat style
- Large-scale battles
- Strategic positioning focus
- Macro-level decision-making

### Combat Mechanics
- **Spellcasting Inputs**: Skill-based spell execution
- **Cooldown Management**: Strategic timing of powerful spells
- **Environmental Interaction**: Use terrain and conditions tactically
- **Resource Management**: Balance Focus and Essence in combat
- **Adaptive Enemies**: Enemies learn and counter repeated tactics

---

## 8. Spell & Magic System

**Purpose**: Core player power expression through tactical and strategic magic.

### Spell Categories
- **Quick Spells**: Focus-based, frequent use
- **Powerful Spells**: Essence-based, devastating effects
- **Environmental Spells**: Terrain manipulation
- **Summoning**: Ally creation (with betrayal risk)

### Casting Mechanics
- **Input Mastery**: Skill-based casting with forgiveness
- **Cooldown Strategy**: Time-gating for powerful spells
- **Overheat Risk**: Penalty for reckless casting
- **Combo Potential**: Spell + environment interactions

### Spell Consequences
- **Terrain Transformation**: Permanent world changes
- **Uncontrolled Effects**: Spells that rage beyond intent
- **Enemy Adaptation**: Repeated spell use builds resistance
- **Environmental Chain Reactions**: Water conducts lightning, fire spreads, etc.

---

## 9. Consequence & Reputation System

**Purpose**: Make every action have lasting impact on the world.

### Action Consequences

#### Destruction
- Destroyed cities create refugee bandits
- Scorched earth creates hostile terrain
- Resource depletion affects future options
- Environmental damage persists

#### Summoning
- Summoned allies may betray later
- Magical disruption awakens ancient evils
- Overuse of magic makes land barren

#### Victory/Defeat
- Major victories cause territory submission
- Defeats damage reputation
- Reputation affects future conquest difficulty
- Creates cycles of power and vulnerability

### World Response
- **Adaptive Enemies**: Factions learn player tactics
- **Countermeasures**: Enemies prepare for known strategies
- **Coalitions**: Rivals unite against powerful players
- **Opportunism**: Enemies exploit player weakness

---

## 10. Progression System

**Purpose**: Create meaningful growth through hard-won victories.

### Power Growth
- New spell acquisition
- Increased resource capacity
- Expanded territory control
- Growing reputation and influence

### Strategic Growth

- Mastering spell inputs
- Understanding environmental interactions
- Developing long-term tactics

### Risk of Regression
- Defeats can lose territory

- Potential for complete loss ("lose everything")

---

## 11. Adaptive Enemy AI System

**Purpose**: Create intelligent opposition that forces player adaptation.

### Learning Mechanics
- Track player spell usage patterns
- Develop resistances to repeated tactics
- Prepare countermeasures
- Share intelligence between factions

### Strategic Behavior
- Form coalitions against powerful players
- Exploit overextension
- Attack during player weakness
- Adapt to player strategy changes

### Reset Opportunities
- Changing tactics resets enemy advantages
- New approaches catch enemies unprepared
- Strategic variety rewarded over repetition

---

## 12. Environmental System

**Purpose**: Create dynamic terrain that affects tactical and strategic decisions.

### Terrain Features
- **Water**: Conducts lightning (double-edged)
- **Fire**: Creates cover, spreads uncontrollably
- **Frost**: Creates barriers, traps allies
- **Forests**: Can be destroyed, creates deserts
- **Strategic Locations**: Natural choke points and defensive positions

### Dynamic Changes
- Player spells transform terrain
- Transformations persist
- Changed terrain affects future battles
- Environmental features can backfire

### Tactical Opportunities
- Combo spells with terrain
- Exploit enemy positioning
- Create strategic advantages
- Environmental hazards affect both sides

## System Interactions

### Key Feedback Loops

1. **Expansion Loop**: Control territory → Gain resources → Cast more spells → Control more territory
2. **Reputation Loop**: Win battles → Gain reputation → Easier conquests → More power → Bigger threats
3. **Consequence Loop**: Use magic → Change environment → Affect future battles → Adapt tactics
4. **Learning Loop**: Enemy learns → Player adapts → Enemy adapts → Strategic evolution
5. **Alliance Loop**: Protect allies → Gain bonuses → More power to protect → More enemies target allies

### Balancing Tensions

- **Tactical vs Strategic**: Immediate spell needs vs long-term resource planning
- **Expansion vs Defense**: Growing territory vs protecting holdings
- **Power vs Vulnerability**: Using power creates threats and weaknesses
- **Risk vs Reward**: Aggressive tactics vs safe play
- **Variety vs Mastery**: Changing tactics to confuse enemies vs mastering specific approaches
