# Creative Brief: Arcane Dominion

## Raw Game Vision
You play both as a god as well as a priest of your religion. Your job as a priest is to influence the world for the better or the worse, spreading the domain of your god. You do this by making friends with villages, establishing shrines, connecting with the relics of the world. Your goal later shifts to protecting your allies (of your priest and of your religion, which can be separate) and destroying your enemies. 

These villages and shrines will provide distinct bonuses to you. You'll feel their benefit as you gain them and hurt once you lose them. You try and capture leylines and harvest the natural resources of the world. You'll need to protect them in times of crisis to keep getting their benefit.

I want to create a game with a living world. World events happen on their own. Bandits may decide to attack. Monsters may decide to attack. Nations motivated by other gods may be encouraged to attack ones that are friendly to you.

We should try and capture the essence of battle brothers combat. We could do Total War style (idling style) or battle brothers style (you have 12 brothers and you try and crush tens of enemies without losing any of them).


## World Design
The world is a brutal, unforgiving place where your power means nothing without strategy:
- **Nations at War**: Rival empires clash constantly, forming temporary alliances against you when your power threatens them, or exploiting your weaknesses when you're vulnerable.
- **Forces of Evil**: Ancient evils and monstrous threats awaken as your magic disrupts the natural order. Some you can ally with, others you must destroy before they consume everything.
- **Living Systems**: The world changes based on your actions and inactions. Neglect regions and they fall to chaos. Overuse destructive magic and the land becomes barren and hostile.
- **Reactive Environment**: Your spells have real consequences - destroy a forest and create a desert that enemies can use against you. Summon storms and they might rage out of control.
- **Strategic Terrain**: Environmental features work for and against you - water conducts your lightning but also your enemies', fire creates cover but also burns uncontrollably, frost creates barriers but also traps your allies.
- **Adaptive Enemies**: Factions learn from your tactics. Use the same spells repeatedly and they'll prepare countermeasures. Change your approach and you gain the advantage.

## Key Mechanics
- **Limited Power**: You can shape reality, but only within your means. Overextend and you become vulnerable. Underuse your power and enemies grow stronger.
- **Consequential Actions**: Every spell has lasting effects. Destroy a city and create refugees who become bandits. Summon allies and they might betray you later.
- **Adapt or Die**: The world responds to your tactics. Use fire spells repeatedly and enemies develop fire resistance. Change your approach or lose everything.
- **Campaign Consequences**: Your victories and defeats ripple through the world. Win a major battle and territories submit. Lose badly and your reputation suffers, making future conquests harder.
- **Spell Management**: Balance immediate tactical needs with long-term strategy. Waste a powerful spell on a minor threat and you might lose the war.
- **Input Mastery**: Spellcasting requires practice and adaptation. Learn the inputs through experience, or watch enemies exploit your mistakes in combat.
- **Resource Management**: Balance Focus for quick spells against Essence for devastating ones. Overheat from reckless casting and you become temporarily powerless.
- **Cooldown Strategy**: Powerful spells take time to recharge. Use them at the wrong moment and you lose the battle. Save them for critical moments and you turn the tide.

## Emotional Journey
- **Tactical Triumph**: The hard-won satisfaction of outsmarting superior forces through clever spell timing and battlefield adaptation.
- **Strategic Depth**: The cerebral pleasure of long-term planning - positioning for future advantages, learning enemy patterns, and turning the world's chaos to your advantage.
- **Resilience Through Loss**: The bitter lessons of defeat that forge true mastery. Lose battles, learn from mistakes, adapt your tactics, and come back stronger.
- **Hard-Earned Growth**: Building power through relentless struggle - every victory a step toward dominance, every defeat a teacher of humility and cunning.

## Unique Selling Points
- **Tangible Power**: Unlike abstract god powers in other games, here your magic visibly transforms the world - you create deserts where forests stood, summon storms that rage for days, and leave scars that enemies exploit.
- **Real Consequences**: Every spell matters. Destroy a city and face refugee bandits. Summon allies who later betray you. Your actions shape a world that fights back.
- **Strategic Investment**: Deep emotional attachment comes from hard-won progress. Each victory builds your legend, each defeat teaches crucial lessons that make you stronger.
- **Tactical Spellcasting**: Experience the satisfaction of MOBA-style outplay in single-player - perfect cooldown management and timing that wins battles and turns the tide of wars.
- **Forgiving Mastery**: Complex spellcasting that's accessible through practice. Input forgiveness and assistance modes let you focus on strategy while building skill.
- **Adaptive Tension**: Constant balance between immediate tactical decisions and long-term strategic planning. Poor choices lose battles, smart ones win campaigns.
- **Experimental Magic**: Combine spells with environmental features for unique tactical opportunities. Water conducts lightning, fire creates smoke screens, frost makes terrain slippery.

## Target Experience
Players should feel like ruthless conquerors in a brutal fantasy world. You start weak and vulnerable, but through clever tactics, strategic adaptation, and hard-won victories, you become a force that can reshape nations. The satisfaction comes from outsmarting superior enemies, turning the environment against your foes, and watching your reputation grow as territories submit to your power. But lose badly and you lose everything - your power, your allies, your progress. Every decision matters, every spell has consequences, and true mastery comes from learning to adapt or perish.

## Art Direction
- **Gritty Fantasy**: A dark, realistic fantasy world where magic feels dangerous and unpredictable, not ethereal and beautiful.
- **Consequential Destruction**: Spells visibly scar the landscape - craters from explosions, charred earth from fire, frozen wastelands from ice magic.
- **Strategic Visibility**: Clear visual feedback on spell effects, enemy positions, environmental hazards, and tactical opportunities.
- **Character Evolution**: Your wizard's appearance shows the toll of power - scars, weathered robes, glowing eyes that reflect your growing but dangerous magic.
- **Battlefield Clarity**: UI elements that support tactical decision-making - cooldown timers, resource levels, environmental effects, and enemy telegraphing.

## Sound Design
- **Raw Spellcasting**: Spells sound dangerous and unpredictable - crackling energy, roaring flames, shattering ice, not beautiful harmonies.
- **World Reactions**: The environment responds realistically to your magic - earth cracks and rumbles, winds howl chaotically, survivors scream in terror or celebration.
- **Evolving Tension**: Music that reflects your current situation - tense during battles, triumphant after victories, somber after defeats.
- **Tactical Audio**: Clear feedback for spell success/failure, cooldown readiness, resource levels, and enemy movements to support strategic decision-making.

## Success Criteria
- Players feel the hard-won satisfaction of strategic victories - outmaneuvering enemies through clever spell timing and environmental exploitation.
- The world actively resists and adapts to player actions, creating meaningful strategic challenges and forcing constant adaptation.
- Players develop deep investment through hard-earned progress - each victory builds toward greater power, each defeat teaches crucial tactical lessons.
- New abilities feel like meaningful tactical upgrades that change how you approach battles and campaigns.
- Players master the cerebral satisfaction of cooldown management and timing, where smart spell usage wins battles and poor decisions lose them.
- Spellcasting is challenging but fair - complexity rewards practice and strategic thinking, with assistance modes for accessibility.
- The tension between tactical execution and strategic planning creates engaging, replayable gameplay without frustrating difficulty walls.
