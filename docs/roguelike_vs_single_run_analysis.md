# Roguelike vs Single Run Experience Analysis

## Core Objectives Analysis
The game centers on three key objectives:
1. **Power Growth Journey**: Player progression from apprentice to world-shaping archmage
2. **Satisfaction of World-Altering Actions**: The visceral pleasure of wielding massive powers with visible consequences
3. **Living, Responsive World**: A world with independent forces that react to player actions

## Single Run Experience - Recommended

### Why Single Run Better Serves Core Objectives

#### 1. Power Growth & Narrative Satisfaction
- **Cumulative Power Building**: Single run allows for a cohesive, escalating power curve where each new ability builds meaningfully on previous ones
- **Emotional Investment**: Players develop deep attachment to their growing capabilities and the world they've shaped
- **Narrative Coherence**: A single continuous story allows for meaningful character development and world-altering consequences that persist
- **Satisfaction Through Mastery**: The journey from novice to god-like being feels earned and transformative

#### 2. World-Altering Satisfaction
- **Persistent World Changes**: Single run enables permanent, cumulative world transformation that players can witness and build upon
- **Consequence Amplification**: Actions compound over time - early spells create foundations for later cataclysmic effects
- **Legacy Building**: Players create lasting monuments to their power that remain throughout their journey
- **Scale Appreciation**: The contrast between early small spells and late-game world-shaking magic is more impactful in a single narrative

#### 3. Living World Dynamics
- **Evolving Global Context**: Nations, wars, and evils develop in response to player actions over an extended timeframe
- **Relationship Building**: Long-term interactions with factions, allies, and antagonists create meaningful relationships
- **World Memory**: The world "remembers" player actions and evolves accordingly, creating a truly responsive environment
- **Strategic Depth**: Players can plan long-term campaigns, positioning themselves for greater influence

### Problems with Roguelike Approach

#### 1. Power Growth Fragmentation
- **Reset Progression**: Death resets power, undermining the core objective of sustained growth
- **Shallow Power Fantasy**: Temporary power spikes lack the satisfaction of permanent mastery
- **Narrative Disruption**: Character death interrupts the transformation journey
- **Mechanical Focus**: Emphasis shifts from magical growth to survival mechanics

#### 2. Reduced World-Altering Satisfaction
- **Transient Changes**: World alterations disappear with death, reducing impact
- **Limited Scale**: Hard to justify massive world-changing effects when they don't persist
- **Shorter Sessions**: Less time to experience the full scope of world-shaping power
- **Repetitive Setup**: Rebuilding power feels like grinding rather than meaningful progression

#### 3. Living World Compromises
- **Context Loss**: World state resets, losing accumulated political, social, and magical developments
- **Shallow Relationships**: Can't develop deep connections with NPCs or factions across multiple sessions
- **Reduced Stakes**: World events feel less consequential when they can be "reset"
- **Procedural Limitations**: Hard to create truly meaningful living systems that persist beyond a single run

## Single Run Implementation Strategy

### Save System Design
- **Comprehensive Saves**: Save game state, world state, character progression, and relationship status
- **Multiple Save Slots**: Allow players to experiment with different power paths
- **Checkpoint System**: Regular autosaves to prevent progress loss
- **Backup Saves**: Protect against corruption or unwanted story branches

### Difficulty & Accessibility
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: World responds to player power level, maintaining challenge
- **Optional Permadeath**: Allow players to disable death consequences for accessibility
- **Save Scumming Prevention**: Design systems that discourage excessive reloading
- **Meaningful Failure**: Death should feel like a significant setback, not just an inconvenience

### Replayability Through Choice
- **Branching Paths**: Multiple approaches to power growth create different playthroughs
- **Moral Choices**: Decisions that fundamentally alter world and character development
- **Spell Combinations**: Emergent magic systems allow for unique power expressions
- **Achievement System**: Unlock new starting options or cosmetic rewards for completion

### Session Management
- **Long-Form Sessions**: Design for 10-20 hour campaigns with save/resume capability
- **Pacing Balance**: Mix high-intensity action with contemplative world-building moments
- **Break Points**: Natural stopping points where players feel satisfied with progress
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear indicators of power growth and world impact

## Counterarguments & Mitigations

### Player Investment Risk
- **Mitigation**: Strong checkpoint system and ability to save at any time
- **Backup**: Multiple save slots and cloud saves
- **Safety Net**: Optional "story mode" with reduced consequences

### Burnout Prevention
- **Mitigation**: Varied activities (exploration, spellcraft, diplomacy, combat)
- **Pacing**: Mix high-stakes moments with peaceful development phases
- **Modular Design**: Allow players to focus on preferred activities

### Replay Value Concerns
- **Mitigation**: Deep systems allow for vastly different playthroughs
- **Content**: Extensive spell combinations, world exploration, and choice consequences
- **Meta Progression**: Unlock new abilities, cosmetic options, or alternate starting conditions

## Conclusion

For a game centered on the **satisfaction of growing power and world-altering actions**, a **single run experience** is strongly recommended. The core emotional payoff comes from the cumulative journey of transformation and the lasting impact on a living world - elements that roguelike structure fundamentally undermines.

Roguelike mechanics could be incorporated as optional modes or specific challenges, but the main experience should allow players to build and maintain their power in a persistent world that reacts meaningfully to their god-like influence.
